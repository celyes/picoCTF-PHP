### Picobrowser

by reading the hints, it's obvious that we won't need a browser. what we need is a tool that can send http requests and customize the user-agent that the request is sent from.

cURL seems like the tool for this challenge, so by executing this command: 
`curl -A 'picobrowser' https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44577/flag`
we receive an HTML page that simply contains the flag.

the flag is : `picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_e9b160d0}`
