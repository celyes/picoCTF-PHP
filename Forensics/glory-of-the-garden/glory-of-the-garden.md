### Glory of the Garden

After downloading the [image](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/43c4743b3946f427e883f6b286f47467/garden.jpg)and opening it, it seems like a normal picture. 

However, when opening this image with a hex editor (e.g: Hexyl) (see challenge hint), the flag can be found at the very bottom.
 
the flag is: `picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3657BaB2C}`
